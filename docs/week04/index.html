    <p>Representing Data</p>
  </section>

	<h1>Beyond Arrays</h1>
	<p>Arrays are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things of the same type together so you can work with
	them, an array is the way to go. But what about more complicated data? Consider this situation, you need to write 
	code to track medications in a pharmacy. For each medication you need to track its name, the amount of the medication, 
	its unique code, and expiration date. If you do this with arrays, your code could look something like this, the worst 
	possible implementation.
	<pre><code class="JavaScript">let names = ['Lactated Ringers','levothyroxine','rosuvastatin','albuterol','esomeprazole']
let amounts = ['100L','2000ct','1500ct','1325ct','23145ct']
let codes = ['13ab7','at342','gr5423','iuy6532','mnb78932']
let expDateDate = ['12/30/2029','03/18/2021','09/01/2020','01/01/2023','10/01/2021']
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>This code is intrinsically unstable. To work with this data, your code must keep track of and use the same index across all three 
		arrays. However, as the data becomes more and more complicated, not just more data, the medication information will become corrupted. It is too difficult to 
	keep everything straight; everything lined up, let alone passing this data to a function. Bugs will creap into this code and the application it is part of will fail. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is a slightly better way to solve this problem using a two dimentional array.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="JavaScript">let medications = [['Lactated Ringers','levothyroxine','rosuvastatin','albuterol','esomeprazole'],
		   ['100L','2000ct','1500ct','1325ct','23145ct'],
		   ['13ab7','at342','gr5423','iuy6532','mnb78932'],
		   ['12/30/2029','03/18/2021','09/01/2020','01/01/2023','10/01/2021']]
</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		This code is more organized, but has the same index and complicatedness problem as the first example, though it is easier
		 to pass the data in this form to a function. However, when writing code using this data, you have to remember the order and indices 
		 of all the sub-arrays. This will be a constant problem as the data is passed, bugs fixed, and the data becomes more complicated. Thankfully,
	the creators of JavaScript provided a way out of this mess...defined objects.</p>	
	<h3>Defined Objects - keeping related data together </h3>
	<p>Defined objects allow us to mingle different types of data together, and build relationships between the data. Using the 
	medication example, you could put a bunch of objects in an array. Each of these objects would hold one medication's name, its manufacturer, its best-by
	date, the amount of the medication on hand, and if that amount is a count or a volume in liters, milliliters, etc.</p>

	<p>
		The way you would accomplish this in JavaScript is to apply the concept of a key-value pair. Being a BYU-Idaho student, you are familiar with key-value
		pairs already. Your iNumber is a key, and the data you supplied to the school about yourself is the value. Applying this concept to the medications data 
		representation problem, a possible, though not optimal, solution looks like this, where id, amount, amountType, and expDate are the keys, and key-value pairs 
		are seperated by commas.
	</p>

	<pre><code class="JavaScript">let lactatedRingers = {'id':'13ab7','amount':100,'amountType':'L','expDate':'12/30/2029'}
let levothyroxine = {'id':'at342','amount':2000,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'03/18/2021'}
let rosuvastatin = {'id':'gr5423','amount':1500,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'09/01/2020'}
let albuterol = {'id':'iuy6532','amount':1325,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'01/01/2023'}
let esomeprazole = {'id':'mnb78932','amount':23145,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'10/01/2021'}
</code>
	</pre>
<p>
	To access the value associated with one of the keys, you use the name of the variable for the defined object and apply the key to look up the value.
</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let anAmount = rosuvastatin['amount']
</code>
</pre>
<p>
	The variable anAmount would now contain 1500.
</p>
<p>
	Changing a value works much like the code to modify a value in an array, but you would apply a key instead of using an array index. 
</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">rosuvastatin['amount'] = 1455
</code>
</pre>
<p>Though this solution improves on the array representations, it suffers from having to pass each of the medications to functions that may work with or on the data. Also, it 
	is easy to accidentally disconnect the medication names from their associated data. An additional layer of keys and values 
	is needed to resolve this problem. In this solution, a defined object for all the medications contains other defined objects. This is much like a two dimentional array, 
	an array that contains other arrays. Here, the name of the medication, with correct capitalization, is used as a key, and the data for that medication is the 
	key's associated value. 
</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let medications = {'Lactated Ringers' : {'id':'13ab7','amount':100,'amountType':'L','expDate':'12/30/2029'},
'Levothyroxine' : {'id':'at342','amount':2000,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'03/18/2021'},
'Rosuvastatin' : {'id':'gr5423','amount':1500,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'09/01/2020'},
'Albuterol' : {'id':'iuy6532','amount':1325,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'01/01/2023'},
'Esomeprazole' : {'id':'mnb78932','amount':23145,'amountType':'ct','expDate':'10/01/2021'}}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
	Another advantage of this organization of the data is there is no need to remember the order of the data. 
	If you wanted all the data for Lactated Ringers, the code would look like this. 
</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aMedication = medications['Lactated Ringers']
</code>
</pre>
<p>
	To get the same data for Lactated Ringers from the 2 dimentional array implementation the code would look like this,
</p>
<p><pre><code class="JavaScript">let aName = medications[0][0]
let anAmount = medications[1][0]
let anId = medications[2][0]
let anExpirationDate = medications[3][0]
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>a much less readable, intuitive, and debuggable solution.</p>
<p>Using the defined objects to get the expiration date 
	for Albuterol without getting all the data for Albuterol, your code would look like this,
</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications['Albuterol']['expDate']
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>where getting it using the 2 dimentional array implementation would look like this.</p>

<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications[4][4]
</code>
</pre>
<p>To change the amount of Rosuvastatin on hand, the code would look like this,</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">medications['Rosuvastatin']['amount'] = 1432
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>instead of like this, using the 2 dimentional array.</p>
<p><pre><code class="JavaScript">medications[2][3] = '1432ct'
</code>
</pre></p>
<h3>There is Another Way</h3>
<p>When you have defined objects, there is another way to access an change values. It uses what is called 'dot notation' 
	by the JavaScript community. Let's look at the example where the amount of Rosuvastatin was changed again. 
	You could do it like this.
</p>
<p><pre><code class="JavaScript">medications.Rosuvastatin.amount = 1432
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>
	That's kind of nice. Many fewer characters to type. You drop all the brackets and quotation marks. But can you 
	use dot notation to set a value? Yep. You can. Here is the Albutorol example from earlier rewritten using dot notation.
</p>

<p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications.Albuterol.expDate
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>
	It may seem that, because dot notation is so much less wordy, it should always be used. Not so fast. 
	There are times when it doesn't work. It only works when you know what the keys are at the time you are writting your code. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Suppose you had a user interface where the user selected the name of the medication to display the expiration data for. 
	Now you have a problem. You have to put what the user selected into a variable in order to be able to use it. 
	Let's say you put it in a variable called 'selectedMedication'. The temptation is to think that this code would work.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications.selectedMedication.expDate
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>It doesn't. This code does work though.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications[selectedMedication]['expDate']
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>This code works too. It combines both approaches and is probably the cleanest code to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript">let aBestByDate = medications[selectedMedication].expDate
</code>
</pre></p>
<p>If nothing else, JavaScript is very flexible. So which one should you use? It depends on which works to solve the 
	problem you are working on. Pick the one that is the simplest for any given situation.

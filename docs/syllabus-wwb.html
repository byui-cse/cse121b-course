      <h1>Syllabus</h1>
      <p>
        In this course you will see how the principles of programming you
        learned in CSE 110 and 111 are used to solve problems in your
        discipline. To that end, all of your assignments in this class will come
        from your major discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that your goal in this course, as it should be in any other that
        you undertake, should be understanding and not just completion. Failure
        to understand and internalize the topics from this course will lead to
        difficulty in completing many future courses including: WDD 230, WDD
        330, WDD 430, and CSE 341.
      </p>
      <h3>Design Principles</h3>
      <p>This course is based on the following principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>lifting others in the class,</li>
        <li>using your agency,</li>
        <li>showing empath and love, and</li>
        <li>
          being humble enough to ask for help from your teacher and others in
          the class.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All tasks assigned to you in this course are welcome to be completed in
        teams. Form learning teams and leverage the strength that can come from
        them. Work in teams, but know that you will never be given a team grade.
        Each of us here on earth work together to aid each other in achieving
        salvation and exhaltation, yet we are individually responsible for our
        own salvation and exhaltation. Nobody makes it to the Celestial Kingdom
        because they belonged to a group of good people. Neither should you
        expect to get an A just because you are part of a group of hardworking
        students that come to understand the topics of this course and are able
        to apply them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, when you are helping someone you should never give them a
        code solution. Neither should you expect a code solution when you ask
        for help. Instead, help those who will come to you by talking over how
        they are thinking about and approaching the problem, showing them how to
        search for and find an answer, and be loving and supportive. In
        otherwords, teach them just like you would teach someone the Gospel of
        Jesus Christ. Love them, help them find their own answer, and lead them
        to the scriptures.
      </p>

      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        You must have successfully completed CSE 111 or something equivalent.
      </p>
      <h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
      <p>
        You will need a laptop computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. The
        laptop must have sufficient hard drive space for the installation of the
        JavaScript IDE, and toolset. Internet connectivity is also required.
        There is no text, all readings are found in iLearn.
      </p>
      <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
      <p>To successfully complete this course, you must be able to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          translate simple, well defined, discipline specific algorithms to
          JavaScript (Algorithm - a clear and complete set of instructions),
        </li>
        <li>create functions in JavaScript from well-defined descriptions,</li>
        <li>
          setup and be familiar with the development environment for JavaScript
          so you can write code to solve problems as part of courses in your
          discipline,
        </li>
        <li>
          write code using JavaScript specific syntax and style, including
          comments, and
        </li>
        <li>find help for how to use JavaScript syntax.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Course Structure</h3>
      <p>
        This is a block course. In weeks 1 â€“ 5 you will have assigned reading,
        an interaction with other class members, and a programming assignment.
        Week 6 is dedicated to you completing an appropriately sized project
        that applies the JavaScript expression of the basic building blocks of
        programming and functions. The project is one selected and produced for
        your discipline. Week 7 is your opportunity to ponder on the different
        sources of information regarding JavaScript syntax help sources. Use
        week 7 to create rules for yourself regarding what differentiates a good
        source from a poor one. Compare your set of rules with those created by
        your team members. Then ponder again to see if you should, or should
        not, update your rule set to include ideas from theirs.
      </p>

      <h3>Assessments</h3>
      <p>
        Each week there will be one or more learning activities. You should turn
        in your work on the <strong>Prove</strong> activity for each week to be
        graded. Please do not skip the other activities! They are critical to
        help you to understand the topics of each week.
      </p>
      <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
      <p>The final percentage will determine your grade as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;93.00%-100%</li>
        <li><b>A-</b>&nbsp; 90.00%-92.99%</li>
        <li><b>B+&nbsp;</b>87.00%-89.99%</li>
        <li><b>B</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;83.00%-86.99%</li>
        <li><b>B-</b>&nbsp; 80.00%-82.99%</li>
        <li><b>C+</b> 77.00%-79.99%</li>
        <li><b>C</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;73.00%-76.99%</li>
        <li><b>C-</b>&nbsp; 70.00%-72.99%</li>
        <li><b>D+</b> 67.00%-69.99%</li>
        <li><b>D</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;63.00%-66.99%</li>
        <li><b>D-</b>&nbsp; 60.00%-62.99%</li>
        <li><b>F</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; below 60%</li>
      </ul>

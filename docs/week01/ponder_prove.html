      <!-- <h2>VS Code</h2>
      <p>
        Visual Studio Code has a lot to offer to help developers be more
        efficient in their work.
        <strong
          >It is worth spending some time to learn what it can do for
          you!</strong
        >
        Hopefully you spent some time with the resources in the
        <a href="index.html">Installation and Purpose</a> reading. To continue
        review the following resources:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Watch at least the first 2 videos of

          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          ...then read
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"

        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        Most good editors allow for customization by it's users. VS Code is no
        exception. Programmers can extend the functionality of the editor by
        creating <em>Extensions</em>. There are a few that you should install
        right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are installed through the editor itself. If you are unsure how to
        install an extension visit this link to
        <a
          href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          >the instructions on the VS Code site</a
        >
        or watch the third video in the link above.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Required: <strong>Live Server by Ritwick Dey</strong> -- Launches your
          pages in the browser for preview with live reload. (Automatically
          refreshes the page in the browser when you save your changes in VS
          Code)
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional: <strong>Beautify</strong> -- Formats your code to keep it
          more readable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After installing the Live Server extension, you may need to do a small
        amount of configuration. If Chrome is not set as your system default
        browser, we can set Live Server to use it anyway. Do the following to
        set a custom browser for Live Server to use:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on the Gear icon in the bottom left corner of the VS Code
          application window, then select 'Settings'.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Search settings box at the top of the new tab that opened type
          "custom browser"
        </li>
        <li>
          Find the setting "Live Server > Settings: Custom Browser". In the drop
          down below that select "Chrome"
        </li>
      </ol> -->
      <div class="callout">
        <h3>Note!</h3>
        <p>
          Most IDE's rely on the concept of a project to get the full benefit of
          their features. VS Code is no exception. If you do not have a project
          open in VS Code some extensions (including Live Server) will not work
          consistently. Opening a project in VS Code is as simple as opening the
          folder that the code you are working on is in. If the status bar at
          the bottom of the editor is purple, then you do
          <strong>NOT</strong> have a project folder open. You are just working
          on unrelated files. If the status bar is blue you have a project
          folder open. You should almost always be working in a project folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a folder on your computer to contain the files for this course.
          Then open that folder in VS Code.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have other courses that are using VS Code then you should do
          the same: create a folder to hold your work, then switch the open
          project folder for each class. You might find the
          <strong>Project Manager</strong> extension helpful for this. (Or for
          any project that you have previously opened you can quickly switch
          back with File->Open Recent)
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Chrome and debugging</h2>
      <p>
        Google Chrome, the web browser you will be using in this course,
        contains a set of very helpful developer tools. This task doesn't cover
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4q86IjJFag"
          >using all of them</a
        >. Instead it focuses on the built-in stepwise debugger.
      </p>
      <ol class="bigSteps">
        <li>
          <p>
            To start with,
            <a
              href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121b-course/week01/example_source/stepwise_debugging.zip"
              >download the files</a
            >
            we'll play with to help you learn how to use the stepwise debugger.
            Once you've got the zip file downloaded,
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%how to unzip"> unzip it</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p class="callout">
            NOTE! These are the same files that you were asked to download in
            the Prepare section. If you still have them you do not need to
            download them again.
          </p>
          <p class="callout">
            Also note that there are errors in the javascript file. Part of this
            activity is to find and hopefully fix them! You might not recognize
            all of the Javascript syntax yet, but if you follow the debugging
            principles outlined here you should be able to find the errors.
            Finding them is more important than fixing them at this point, but
            give it your best shot!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To accomplish this task, you will need this browser window open with
            the instructions showing and another open showing the hello.html
            file in the zip file. Set up these two windows side-by-side so you
            can see them both at once. The next step is to load the hello.html
            file into the second Chrome browser window. Do this by launching
            Chrome and then drag the hello.html file onto the second window.
            With this done, right click, or control-click for MacOS users, on
            the window and select 'Inspect'. This will open the developer tools
            (There are
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4q86IjJFag"
              >other ways to launch the tools</a
            >
            if you are interested). With the developer tools open, look for and
            select the 'Sources' tab. You should find it at the top of the
            developer tools window.
          </p>
          <p>
            The example you are going to mess with consists of two files,
            hello.html and learning.js. Following industry standard practice,
            all the JavaScript for this example is found in the learning.js
            file. Select learning.js from the left-hand view and the learning.js
            code will appear in the middle view.
          </p>
          <img
            src="example_source/break_point.png"
            alt="The developer tools running, the JavaScript source file selected, and a break point set on line two."
          />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the middle view, you will see a column of numbers indicating the
            line numbers for each line of the code. This column is called 'the
            gutter'. Now click on the 2. You will see a blue indicator show up
            in the gutter. This indicator is showing you where a 'break point'
            has just been set in the code. Breakpoints are how you temporarily
            pause the code's execution so you can see what is actually going on
            in the code rather than what you think might be going on. You are
            now ready to use Chrome's built-in stepwise debugger.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code for this page is designed to run each time the page is
            loaded, so refresh the page
          </p>
          <p>
            What you now see is a bounded blue selection including all of the
            code for line 2. At this point in time, line 2 has not executed.
            Let's make it execute. In the right-hand view of the debugging
            tools, you will see a dot with a bent arrow over it. It looks kind
            of like an eye with an eyebrow. When you move your mouse over it,
            without clicking, a help message pops up letting you know this is
            the 'step over' button. Each time you click this button, the
            highlighted line of code executes. Let's give it a go. Click the
            step over button.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The first thing you'll notice is that the highlighter has moved to
            the next line of code. Now you know the browser is waiting to
            execute that line. Now move your mouse over 'let
            currentDateAndTime'. As you do, it gets a yellow highlight and the
            value of this variable is displayed. Handy!! now you don't have to
            guess what the value is. If you look in the right-hand view, in the
            Scope/Script pulldown, you will also see this same variable and its
            value. You can use which ever way you like to keep track of the
            values of any variable you create in your code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Click the step over button again. Now the next line has executed. In
            the console tab at the bottom of the developer tools you now see "It
            is now " followed by the current date and time. When you use
            console.log to print out values of your variables, you are using
            what in programming speak is called a debug statement. Whether you
            choose to use a debug statement or the stepwise debugger is
            situationally dependent. Your instructor, and your own experience,
            can help you decide when it is best to use which one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The debugger is now 'stopped' on line 7. Line 7 is different. While
            you will learn much more about this later, what you see in line 7 is
            a call to a JavaScript function that returns a value. That value is
            stored in the <code>theTotal</code> variable. Now...if you were to
            (please don't) click the step over button again, you would then see
            the sum of the numbers 1 through 10 in the
            <code>theTotal</code> variable, but we are going to do something
            much more interesting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Next to the step over button, there is another button. This one is a
            dot with an arrow pointing down to it. Move your mouse over it and a
            help message pops up letting you know that this is the 'step into'
            button. Go ahead and click it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wow! The highlighted line of code jumped to line 13! That's because,
            in programmer speak, you stepped into, instead of over, the total
            JavaScript function. Now, as you click the step over button, you can
            watch the value of each number in theNumbers get added to the sum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the numbers have all been added to the sum and the
            debugger is on line 17. Move your mouse over sum or find it in the
            right-hand view and you will find the total is 45. It is important
            to realize you know this BEFORE the function returns the value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Click step over again, and the hightlighted code moves back to line
            9, the next line of code to be executed after line 7. Click step
            over one more time and the result of the calculation is printed to
            the console using JavaScript's Built In Function(BIF), console.log.
          </p>
          <p class="callout">
            Noobs and pro's all use the stepwise debugger. When your code is
            acting up it lets you see EXACTLY what your code is doing instead of
            thinking you know what it is doing. Rule number one of debugging
            your code is "Never assume you know what your code is doing." If you
            follow this rule and use the stepwise debugger, your code debugging
            time will drop dramatically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Play around with this a little bit. Change the numbers being passed
            to the total function and see what happens.
          </p>

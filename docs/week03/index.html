      <h1>Organization and Access</h1>
      <p>
        All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and
        thinking. In this, they are very similar to spoken languages. Each
        spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
        differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper
        Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example. German, a
        language closely related to English, organizes things differently.
        Sometimes German sentences have a Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb
        structure... Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated
        word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish has adjectives
        after the nouns they modify.
      </p>
      <p>
        While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the
        same thing. They allow us to organize and express our thinking.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions - a fundamental organization concept of JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Python and JavaScript, being related languages, both have functions as a
        fundimental organizational structure. When you truly begin thinking in
        JavaScript, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how
        functions are related to each other. You will have thoughts along these
        lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this
        since you will eventually realize that when you are designing solutions
        in JavaScript, how a function accomplishes something is not as important
        as that it will, and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the
        function later.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Python and JavaScript there are similarities and differences between
        the languages regarding how you declare functions. In JavaScript, the
        'function' keyword is used instead of 'def'. Also, JavaScript the
        convention usually used for names of functions and variables is called
        'camel case'. To create a name, the first word of the name starts with a
        lower-case letter, and the first letter of all the rest of the words
        making up the name begin with an upper-case letter. For example, a
        function that averages two numbers could be defined like this.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">function averageTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum){
	return (firstNum+secondNum)/2
}</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        Notice the '{' and '}' operators. These are the JavaScript scope
        operators. These are used instead of the white-space scope operator used
        in Python. In JavaScript, white space means nothing but when writing
        your code, it is important to use white space to help make your code
        easier to read. Never left justify your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with Python, JavaScript functions can have more than one line of
        code. The previous example could be written as
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">function averageTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        It does exactly the same thing, it's just broken up into multiple lines
        of code. There is something of great importance to note in his little
        example. JavaScript and Python share the same scope rules. When let or
        const are used within the scope operators in JavaScript, the variable or
        constant exists only within that scope. In other words, the sum and avg
        variables declared between the scope operators for this function can not
        be used outside of this function.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript does have another keyword, var, that can be used
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/es6-cool-stuffs-var-let-and-const-in-depth-24512e593268"
          >to 'hoist'</a
        >
        the variable outside of its declaring scope, but it can cause logic
        errors in your code and has fallen out of favor with most developers and
        engineers. You should rarely use it, and only when you have a great deal
        of experience with JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h3>Another way to Write Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Having seen the traditional way of declaring a function, it is important
        that you know there are other ways to create functions. The one we'll
        look at this week is called 'function expressions' in the JavaScript
        community. Here is the averageTwoNumbers function written using the
        expression type syntax.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let averageTwoNumbers = function(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        Regardless of if you used a function declaration or expression to creat
        it, you would still call averageTwoNumbers using exactly the same
        syntax, averageTwoNumbers(15,10). So what then is the difference? Why
        would you choose one way over the other?
      </p>
      <p>
        The JavaScript language has a concept called 'global scope'. When you
        use the traditional function declaration syntax, your function is
        created and lives in this global scope. An advantage of this is that you
        could write code using the function declaration that used the function
        BEFORE the function declaration like many other languages allow. Here's
        a simple, syntactically correct example.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">averageTwoNumbers(15,20)
/*
 *
 * a bunch of other code goes here
 *
 */

function averageTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        Wow. This does seem pretty good. It does come with a drawback. When the
        global space becomes too cluttered, the speed of code execution is
        impacted. Too many global functions produces slow code.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK then, why not just use the expression syntax? If you tried to do
        this...
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">averageTwoNumbers(15,20)
/*
 *
 * a bunch of other code goes here
 *
 */

let averageTwoNumbers = function(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        your code will fail to run since the averageTwoNumbers function doesn't
        exist prior to calling it. To make it work you would need to do this
        instead.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let averageTwoNumbers = function(firstNum, secondNum){
	let sum = firstNum+secondNum
	let avg = sum/2
	return avg
}
/*
 *
 * a bunch of other code goes here
 *
 */
averageTwoNumbers(15,20)</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        When you use the function expression syntax, the use of the function HAS
        to happen AFTER the function is created.
      </p>
      <p>
        One question that usually comes up when using the expression syntax is,
        "Hey...aren't we just storing a function in a variable? If so, could we
        change the function stored in the variable?" The answer is yes though
        this is often an advanced JavaScript programming concept. If, on the
        other hand, your variable was a const instead of a let, no such change
        could be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        So which way should we use to create functions? There are lots of
        opinions on that topic. Feel free to read  
        <a href="https://gomakethings.com/function-expressions-vs-function-declarations/">this opinion of one person.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Libraries - sharing your functions with others</h3>
      <p>
        A higher order organizational idea in JavaScript is library. Libraries
        are a way that you can share your code for other programmers to use in
        their applications, and you can share your code with them. Libraries are
        groups of functions that, unlike applications, can not run on their own.
        Instead, you use what other people have written and compiled as if you
        wrote it yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In JavaScript, libraries consist of some number of files in which you
        put your JavaScript. By tradition, the names of your files always ends
        in '.js'. If I had a JavaScript library called totally_awsome, and in it
        there was some code that moved stuff around on the screen, I might put
        that code in a file called 'animations.js'. There would be other files
        in my library that contained other functions doing other things. Each
        file would be named after what it does and use the '.js' name ending.
        For example, fades.js, slideshow.js, etc.
      </p>
      <p class="callout">
        Libraries created like this are simple to make, but do have a few
        drawbacks. The most important is that everything in them gets added to
        the global scope with all of the disadvantages mentioned above. If you
        are interested in learning more about creating small libraries (or
        modules as they are often called) that addresses this scope issue read
        this article:

      <h3>Map, Filter, and Reduce</h3>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, as in most languages, it is important not to write code
        that duplicates fundamental parts of the standard language library. Take
        an <strong>Array</strong> for example as we studied last week. Did you
        wonder when you saw the code example
      </p>
      <pre><code>names.push('Grace')</code></pre>
      <p>
        where the <strong>.push()</strong> came from? It's a built in part of an
        Array in Javascript. Arrays have
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
          >many helpful helper methods</a
        >
        that we can and should use. Please visit that link and familiarize
        yourself with the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it would be possible to write a loop in JavaScript to average,
        modify, or select some elements of an array, you should not. Instead you
        should use the built-in <kbd>filter</kbd> (select some),
        <kbd>reduce</kbd> (average, sum, product, etc.), or
        <kbd>map</kbd> (convert all) functionallity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a situation where you have been hired to write code for a
        social media site. You have been asked to write code to count up the
        total number of 'likes' postings from a single customer has recieved.
        Existing code that others have written puts a likes count for each
        posting in an array called 'likes' for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you were told to filter out all the likes counts that are less
        then 10. How should this be done?
      </p>
      <p>Like this.</p>

      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let filteredLikes = likeCounts.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10)
}</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Let's break this up so you can see how it is done. The filter function
        has one parameter, a function similar to the callback Lambda function
        you learned about in Python. In JavaScript it is called by the less
        Computer Sciencey name of 'anonymous callback function.' This callback
        function has one paramter, an element of the array. This parameter,
        aCount, is seperated by the '=>' operator from the next bit of code
        describing the filtering to be done. In this case, comparing the aCount
        parameter to 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, maybe you have been asked to give the customer five
        'bonus likes' that are to be added to each posting.
      </p>

      <p>How should the likes array be modified?</p>
      <p>
        Like this.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likes = likeCounts.map(aCount => aCount += 5)
</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Maybe you are asked to total the customers likes. How should you do
        that?
      </p>
      <p>
        You would use the reduce function. It has two parameters, the first is a
        function with two paramters and the second is usually called an
        accumulator initial value. The accumulator's initial value is used,
        modified, and returned to accumulates the final result. In this case the
        the final result is the summation of the likes.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let totalLikes = likeCounts.reduce((accumulator, aCount) => accumulator += aCount,0)
</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        What if you are to give five bonus likes only for those that already
        have 10 likes and then sum the result? You could do a seperate line of
        code to accomplish this, or since the map and filter array functions
        return an array, you could do it more professionally like this. It uses
        map, filter, and reduce.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let sum = likeCounts.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10).map(aCount=>aCount += 5).reduce((accumulator, aCount) => accumulator += aCount,0)
</code>
	</pre>

      <p>
        Suppose you wanted to be able to easily test your 'bonus likes' code by
        printing to the console. It would mean your callback function would need
        more than one line of code. You can do that! It would look like this.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likeCounts.filter(aCount => aCount >= 10).map(aCount=>{
		aCount += 5
		console.log(aCount)
		return aCount
		})
</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Notice the use of the JavaScript scope operators and the inclusion of
        the return keyword in the last line of map's callback function. For map,
        whatever is returned by the callback is what ends up in the resulting
        array.
      </p>

      <h2>for-of</h2>
      <p>
        Replacement for the <code>for</code> loop. <code>Array.forEach</code> or
        <code>Array.map</code> are usually better options if you are looping
        over an array (which you often are).
      </p>
      <h2>for-in</h2>
      <p>
        This allows you to iterate over objects. It returns the key of the item
        instead of the value like <code>for of</code>. If you find yourself
        reaching for this often you should probably take a look at how you are
        storing your data...
      </p>
      <h2>while</h2>
      <p>
        <code>while</code> is great for when you need to do something until a
        certain state occurs in your program. You know when you want the loop to
        end...but aren't sure how many loops it will require to get there.

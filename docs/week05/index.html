    <p>Controlling Your Code</p>
  </section>
</header>
	<h1>Choice Making and Computational Flow</h1>
	<p>JavaScript and Python share a set of structures used to control which part of your code is executed, based on specific situations.
	The idea of situational 'computational flow' control isn't unique to Python or JavaScript. It is found in all languages though the 
    way it is accomplished can be different. Review the boolean operators from <a href="../week02/index.html" target="_blank">Week 02</a>. They are 
    used by the control structures you will see below.
    </p>
	<h3>If</h3>
	<p>In JavaScript, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else">if...else if....else statement</a> 
	takes this form,</p>
	<p><pre><code class="javascript">if(boolean expression){
	//code if true
}
else if(boolean expression){
	//code if true
}
else{
	//code if no other match
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
	Notice the boolean expressions have parenthesis around them, and the JavaScript scope operators are used 
	to indicate what lines of code executes in each condition. Here is a code example that evaluates the number of sales 
	of product a company has for one day. The first condition checks if the number of sales is less than or equal to 50. Since the 
	first check has been done, the second actually tests if the number of sales is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 1000. 
	The default, 'else', is is the number of sales being greater than 1000. 
	</p>

	<p><pre><code class="javascript">if(numSales <= 50){
	console.log("Way to few sales");
}
else if(numSales <= 1000){
	console.log("Average number of sales")
}
else{
	console.log("A good number of sales.")
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		There is another way to control your code that behaves similar to an if-else if-else statement. It's 
		called a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp">switch</a>. It can be very helpful if you have large numbers of cases to check. Just be careful using it. 
		It is VERY easy for those not familiar with them to put logic errors in their code using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2922948/javascript-switch-vs-if-else-if-else">switches</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Getting Loopy</h3>
	<p>As mentioned in week 03, JavaScript has built in map, reduce, and filter functions for arrays. It also has a forEach loop that is used with arrays. Go visit <a
		href="https://gist.github.com/ljharb/58faf1cfcb4e6808f74aae4ef7944cff"
		target="_blank"
		rel="noreferrer"
		>this gist on array iteration thoughts</a
	  > for a quick review of some of those array methods we can use to traverse an array.</p>
	<p>
		Maybe, in a different part of the likes application from week 3, you are asked to print each of the like values to the console. You could use 
		the forEach function to do this. 
	</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">likeCounts.forEach(aCount => console.log(aCount))</code>
	</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is an important piece of advice. NEVER use the forEach method when map, filter, reduce, or some combination of them 
		will accomplish the same task. It should rarely ever be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		JavaScript has more types of loops that do things similar to the forEach loop. Use of these should be avoided when possible. Instead, use the 
		map, filter, and reduce functions. If you design well by thinking outside the box, you will probably never need to use these or forEach. They 
		are slower anyway.
	</p>
	<h4>The for-in Loop</h4>
	<p>This is NOT the same as the python for-in loop. It's purpose is to iterate over the properties of an object, allowing you to manipluate or print 
	out the property values associated with each key. We'll use the Lactated Ringers medication object from last week in this example. You could print out 
	each of the values for Lactated Ringers like this.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let aMedication = medications['Lactated Ringers']
for(propertyName in aMedication){
	console.log(aMedication[propertyName])
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h4>The for-of Loop</h4>
	<p>The for-of loop IS the same as the Python for-in loop. It can, but shouldn't, be used to iterate over the elements of a list, set, map, or other type of 
	data structure. It won't iterator over the properties of a defined object.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let ages = [3,5,-1]
for(anAge of ages){
	console.log(anAge)
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h4>The for Loop</h4>
	<p>Here is another type of loop you shouldn't use. The C-like for loop. JavaScript doesn't have the concept of a range. Heaven forbid 
	you should use this loop to accomplish something 10 or some other number of times, but this is how you would do it.</p>
	<p><pre>
<code class="JavaScript">for(var i = 1, i <=10, i++){
	console.log(i)
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h4>The while Loop</h4>
	<p>Like Python's while loop, JavaScript's while loop works with a single boolean logic check to assess the state of your application 
		by assessing one or more boolean logic statements. As long as the logic statements are true, the loop continues looping.
	Otherwise it stops. Again, you may never need to use this loop if you wisely apply map, filter, and reduce.</p>
	<p><pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let total = 0
while(total < 10){
	console.log(total)
	total++
}</code>
	</pre></p>

      <h1>Some Similarities and Differences</h1>
      <h3>Shared Operators</h3>
      <p>
        Remember, both Python and JavaScript have C as one of their ancestors.
        Because of this, it is not shocking to find out that they share many of
        the same operators as C. These include +, -, /, *, ==, !=, &lt, &gt,
        etc. By going to these two sites, you can compare the operators for the
        two languages.

          target="_blank"
          >JavaScript's list of operators</a
        >. When you do so, you will find that Python has a few that JavaScript
        does not. You will also see that the conditional operators, also known
        as logical operators, exist in both languages but use different
        characters.
      </p>
      <h3>JavaScript's missing operators</h3>
      <p>
        Because Python and JavaScript are different languages and the creators
        of JavaScript had different opinions than those who created Python,
        there are some Python operators you should not expect to find in
        JavaScript. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>// - the floor division operator</li>
        <li>&lt&gt - an alternative to !=</li>
        <li>**= - the exponent and assign operator</li>
        <li>and - the logical and operator</li>
        <li>or - the locical or operator</li>
        <li>not - the logical not operator</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Don't get the wrong idea. Each of these behaviors can be done in
        JavaScript, they will just be done a little differently. Take a look at
        Table 1 to see how.
      </p>

      <table class="blueTable">
        <caption>
          Table 1: C Equivalents of Python Operators
        </caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Python</th>
            <th>JavaScript</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>a//b</td>
            <td>Math.floor(a/b)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a &lt&gt b</td>
            <td>a != b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a**=b</td>
            <td>a = Math.pow(a,b)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a and b</td>
            <td>a && b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a or b</td>
            <td>a || b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>not(a and b)</td>
            <td>!(a && b)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        JavaScript has
        <a
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp"
          target="_blank"
          >other operators</a
        >
        available as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Variables</h3>
      <p>
        In Python, a variable can hold any type of value and can change the type
        of value it holds. For example, this code is valid in Python.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="Python">age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2
age = 'old'</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        JavaScript variables behave in much the same way. Just like in Python,
        they can hold any type and the type can change. However, JavaScript does
        require you to use the let keyword to declare a variable. Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="JavaScript">let age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2
age = 'old'</code>
	</pre>
      <h3>Constants</h3>
      <p>In Python, Constants are declared using an all upper case name</p>

      <pre>
<code class="Python">PI=3.14</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        In JavaScript this is done differently, instead of using all upper case
        names, JavaScript requires the use of the const keyword. Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
<code>const PI = 3.14</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        While it is not required that the names of your constants be all upper
        case, it is considered good form.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Wrap Up</h3>

      <p>
        As with all things, there are pluses and minuses of requiring keywords
        like const and let and having or not having some operators. One
        disadvantage of requiring let and const is the extra cluttering of the
        code with 'unnecessary' words. An advantage is explicitness. Everyone
        that later reads your code will know exactly what you meant to have
        happen. Also, because of this explicitness, a variable can't be
        accidentally declared twice in JavaScript, a situation which can produce
        strange, difficult to debug, bad behavior in large Python code sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which operator set to use in a language often depends on the languages
        the language create likes and dislikes. Perhaps the creators of Python
        thought the syntax of Structured Query Language (SQL) was easier to
        understand and so they adopted its and, or, and not operators. This is
        opinion and as such it and the alternative C operators used in
        JavaScript, &&, ||, !, are just as valid. Don't get caught up in the
        psuedo-religious ferver that some programmers adopt. Every language is
        good at some things and bad at others. This includes both Python and
        JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h1>Arrays</h1>
      <p>In JavaScript, arrays can be declared like this.</p>
      <pre><code>
let names = ['Bob','Sue','Jorge','Svetlana']
	</code></pre>
      <p>This should look very familiar to you.</p>
      <p>You access elements of an array like this</p>
      <pre><code>
let aName = names[0]
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        with zero being the index of the first element in the array. Modifying
        values in the array is doable also.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
names[2]='George'
	</code></pre>
      <p>Now the third element of the array is George instead of Jorge.</p>
      <p>
        JavaScript has a lot of Built in Functions(BIF's) that you can use to
        modify arrays. Imagine you needed to use an array to keep track of
        customers lined up to see a movie. As people show up, they need to line
        up in the order they arrived. You can simulate this using the push
        method of array.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Bob, Sue, George, and Svetlana were already waiting in line for the
        show in that order, and then Grace showed up too, you would use push to
        add Grace at the end of the array (the back of the line).
      </p>
      <pre><code>
names.push('Grace')
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Print the updated names array to the console and you see Grace added on
        the end.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
console.log(names)//Displays ['Bob','Sue','George','Svetlana','Grace']
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Since you can add elements to the end of the array, surely there is a
        way to remove elements from the end of the array. You do this with the
        pop method.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre><code>
names.pop()
console.log(names)//Displays ['Bob','Sue','George','Svetlana']
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Can you remove elements from the end or add them to the beginning of the
        array? You bet. There are a large number of BIF's that
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"
          target="_blank"
        >
          you can apply to array</a
        >. Check them out. Also, you'll be learning about using filter, sort,
        map, and reduce array BIF's next week.

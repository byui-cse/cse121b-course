      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <h3>Arithmetic and Assignment Operators</h3>
      <p>
        These should feel pretty familiar:

          href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp"
          target="_blank"
          >JS operators</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
      <p>
        Javascript has two equality comparison operators..."==": loose equality,
        and "===": strict equality. Both of these do approximately the same
        thing...they let you know if two values are the same. The difference in
        them is that the double equal allows for the values to be coerced
        (changed) before the comparison is made, while the triple equals does
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that neither equality operator will allow you to check to see if
        the contents of an Array or other Object is the same as another. It can
        only check if two Arrays <em>are the same</em>...ie they are both bound
        to the same value in memory. See example below.
      </p>

      <h2>Coercion</h2>
      <p>
        Coercion is simply the process Javascript uses when it has to do a
        comparison or arithmetic operation between two values that don't match.
        It is important to understand that it happens...and that JS has a few
        guidelines it follows as it is doing it.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Javascript prefers numeric comparisons and will coerce to a primitve
          numeric value if it can
        </li>
        <li>
          In the case of '+' (addition or concatination). If there is a string
          involved...all values will be converted to strings. That's the only
          way JS knows to combine mixed values.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <pre><code class="lang-js">
// These would also be true with a double equals        
3 === 3.0;              // true
"yes" === "yes";        // true
null === null;          // true
false === false;        // true

42 === "42";            // false
"hello" === "Hello";    // false
true === 1;             // false
0 === null;             // false
"" === null;            // false
null === undefined;     // false
//note the difference in a double equal comparison
42 == "42";             // true...the string "42" gets coerced into the number 42
"hello" == "Hello";    // false...are you surprised at this one?
1 == true;              // true...the boolean value true gets coerced into the number 1
null == undefined;     //  true
</code></pre>
      <pre><code class="lang-js">
  // array example
  var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

// assignment is by reference-copy, so
// y references the *same* array as x,
// not another copy of it.
var y = x;

y === x;              // true...both variables are bound to the exact same array.
y === [ 1, 2, 3 ];    // false...it might look the same, but this is NOT the same array that y is bound to.
x === [ 1, 2, 3 ];    // false
y == [ 1, 2, 3 ];     // false...doesn't work with double equal either :(
</code></pre>

      <h2>Which should I use?</h2>
      <p>
        In most cases you should use the strict equality (triple equals) for
        your comparisons. The double equals is helpful when you are comparing
        two values where the result will be the same whether coercion happens or
        not, or when you don't care if the value is the same type...sometimes
        you want things to be coerced.

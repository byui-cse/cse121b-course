	<h1>Syllabus</h1>
	<p>In this course you will see how the principles of programming you learned in CSE 110 and 111 are used to solve problems in your 
	discipline. To that end, all of your assignments in this class will come from your major discipline.</p>
	<h3>Design Principles</h3>
	<p>This course is based on one underlying principle; that you are a dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ and therefore you would never 
		lie or make deceptive claims regarding your understanding of the course material. Nor would you lie or decieve regarding completion 
		of the task you will be assigned. Other principles include;
		<ul>
			<li>lifting others in the class,</li>
			<li>using your agency,</li>
			<li>showing empath and love, and</li>
			<li>being humble enough to ask for help from your teacher and others in the class.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All tasks assigned to you in this course are welcome to be completed in teams. Form learning teams and leverage the strength that can come from them. Work in teams, but know that you will never be given a team grade. Each of us here on earth work together to aid each other in achieving salvation and 
		exhaltation, yet we are individually responsible for our own salvation and exhaltation. Nobody makes it to the Celestial Kingdom because they 
		belonged to a group of good people. Neither should you expect to get an A just because you are part of a group of hardworking students that 
		come to understand the topics of this course and are able to apply them.</p>
		<p>Therefore, when you are helping someone you should never give them a code solution. Neither should you expect a code solution when you ask for help. 
			Instead, help those who will come to you by talking over how they are thinking about and approaching the problem, showing them how to 
			search for and find an answer, and be loving and supportive. In otherwords, teach them just like you would teach someone the Gospel of 
			Jesus Christ. Love them, help them find their own answer, and lead them to the scriptures.</p>
	</p>
	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>You must have successfully completed CSE 111 or something equivalent.</p>
	<h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
	<p>You will need a laptop computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. The laptop must have sufficient hard drive space for the installation 
		of the JavaScript IDE, and toolset. Internet connectivity is also required. There is no text, all readings are found in iLearn.</p>
	<h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
	<p>To successfully complete this course, you must be able to:
		<ol>
			<li>translate simple, well defined, discipline specific algorithms to JavaScript (Algorithm - a clear and complete set of instructions),</li>
			<li>create functions in JavaScript from well-defined descriptions,</li>
			<li>setup and be familiar with the development environment for JavaScript so you can write code to solve problems as part of courses in your discipline,</li>
			<li>write code using JavaScript specific syntax and style, including comments, and</li>
			<li>find help for how to use JavaScript syntax.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Course Structure</h3>
	<p>This is a block course. In weeks 1 â€“ 5 you will have assigned reading and a reading quiz, an interaction with other class members, 
		and a programming assignment. Week 6 is dedicated to you completing an appropriately sized project that applies the JavaScript expression of 
		the basic building blocks of programming and functions. The project is one selected and produced for your discipline. Week 7 is your opportunity to ponder on the 
		different sources of information regarding JavaScript syntax help sources. Use week 7 to create rules for yourself regarding what differentiates a good source 
		from a poor one. Compare your set of rules with those created by your team members. Then ponder again to see if you should, or should not, update your rule set 
		to include ideas from theirs. 
	</p>

	<h3>Assessments</h3>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>For weeks 1-7, you will be given one or more tasks to accomplish.</li>
			<li>For weeks 1-5 you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have completed the tasks for this week and have a strong understanding 
				of the Javascript syntax and style we learned about this week. Also, after completing my solution to the task, I reviewed the provided solution to 
				learn from another way the task could be completed."</li>
			<li>For week 6 you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have completed my small project and have a strong understanding of all 
				the code I wrote. Also, I wrote the code using the JavaScript syntax and style."</li>
			<li>For week 7, you will state as true or false the validity of the statement, "I have organized my thoughts and described, in writing, the results of 
				pondering what determines if a JavaScript information source is a quality or poor source."</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Grade Calculation</h3>
	<p>There are two possible grades for this course, A or D. If you can honestly answer true for the assessment statements for five or more of the weeks, your score 
	will be an A. If you are not honestly able to answer true for 5 or more weeks, your score will be a D. NOTE: <strong>Week 6 and the project that you will complete that week are required.</strong></p>

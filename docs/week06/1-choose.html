      <h2>What should I do?</h2>
      <p>
        For this week your task is to choose a program to create. The scope
        should be fairly small...about 3 hours. What can you do?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with interests.</li>
        <li>
          Ideas: random sentence generator, specialized timer, pull random
          word/image/etc from an API, pull random fact/joke from api (xkcd),
          pull information for a movie/song from API, Score card for your
          favorite game (farkl, yahtzee, etc), logging app for workouts/study
          time/meals/etc (look into localStorage), choose your own adventure
          game, your own version of Whack-a-mole (hit the dot), tip/sales tax
          calculator
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your own API</h2>
      <p>
        Often developers need to write the code to display information from
        external sources (APIS) before the external source is ready. Tools like
        <a href="https://designer.mocky.io" target="_blank">mocky.io</a> allow
        the developer to <em>mock</em> the external source without having to do
        a bunch of extra work.
      </p>
      <h2>Third part APIs</h2>
      <p>
        You have been tasked to come up with an idea for an application to
        write. There is a good chance that your application will be more useful
        if it can pull information from some source. If you are lucky a free
        open source might exist for the information you need. Something like the
        following for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">pokeapi.co</a>: API with
          information from most of the Pokemon games
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://swapi.dev" target="_blank">swapi.dev</a>: API with
          information from the Star Wars movies
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.hikingproject.com/data" target="_blank"
            >Hiking Project API</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html" target="_blank"
            >USDA Food Data API</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis" target="_blank"
            >...or many, many, others...</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you want to use a free existing API talk with the instructor for
        tips.
      </p>
      <h2>Make a list</h2>
      <p>
        If you go back and review the
        <a
          href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/js/organizing-functions/ponder1/"
        >
          gpa calculator</a
        >
        app we wrote you will see that before we typed any lines of code we made
        a list of steps in plain language to guide us. Go review that briefly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as you settle on an idea, you should do something similar for
        your application. Write down the steps in as much detail as you can
        <strong>before</strong> you start coding. The smaller the steps the
        better. If you get the steps small enough then each step will convert
        into one line of code, and your application will become very easy to
        create.
